public The Java class you provided contains two **static initializer blocks** and a `main` method. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### Code:
```java
class S0017_StaticInitializer {
    static {
        System.out.println("s1");
    }

    static {
        System.out.println("s2");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("in main");
    }
}
```

### Output when executed:
```
s1
s2
in main
```

### Explanation:
- Static blocks are executed **in the order they appear** when the class is **first loaded** by the JVM.
- So:
  1. `System.out.println("s1");` runs first.
  2. Then `System.out.println("s2");`.
- After all static initializers finish, the `main` method is executed:
  - `System.out.println("in main");`.

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into static initializers or explore variations like using static variables, etc. {
