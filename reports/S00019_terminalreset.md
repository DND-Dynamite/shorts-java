Your code defines an interface `S0021_TerminalReset` with a `main` method, which is a bit unusual but **totally valid in Java** because static methods (including `main`) **are allowed in interfaces since Java 8**.

Here's what the code does:

### ‚úÖ Code Breakdown
```java
import java.io.IOException;

interface S0021_TerminalReset {

  static void main(String... args) throws IOException {
    System.out.println("duke is not nice");
    System.out.print("\033c");
  }
}
```

- `System.out.println("duke is not nice");`  
  Prints the message to the terminal.

- `System.out.print("\033c");`  
  This prints the **escape character** (`\033`) followed by `c`, which is the **VT100 control code** to reset the terminal (same as Ctrl+L in many terminals).  
  In practice, it **clears the screen** (depending on terminal support).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- This terminal reset (`\033c`) works mostly on **Unix-like terminals**. On Windows CMD or PowerShell, it may not have any effect.
- The interface can be executed directly like a class because of the static `main` method. You can compile and run it like this:
  ```bash
  javac S0021_TerminalReset.java
  java S0021_TerminalReset
  ```

### üí° Curious Fact
Using interfaces with a `main` method is great for tiny demos or experiments where you don't need state or inheritance.

Let me know if you want to make this portable across terminals or add some animation/effects!
