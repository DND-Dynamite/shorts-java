In Java, the `AutoCloseable` interface is used to indicate that a class has resources that need to be released (like file handles, database connections, etc.) and should be **automatically closed** after usage.

## ‚úÖ **Key Points about `AutoCloseable`**

- Introduced in **Java 7**.
- Used with the **try-with-resources** statement.
- Ensures that resources are **closed automatically** when they are no longer needed.
- Method to implement:  
  ```java
  void close() throws Exception;
  ```

## üîß **Use Case Example**

```java
class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
    @Override
    public void close() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Resource closed");
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Working with resource");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (MyResource resource = new MyResource()) {
            resource.doSomething();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Output:
```
Working with resource
Resource closed
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Common Classes that Implement AutoCloseable**

- `java.io.*` (e.g., `FileInputStream`, `BufferedReader`)
- `java.sql.*` (e.g., `Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`)
- `java.nio.channels.*` (e.g., `FileChannel`)

## üí° Differences: `AutoCloseable` vs `Closeable`

| Feature             | `AutoCloseable`                         | `Closeable`                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Package             | `java.lang`                              | `java.io`                          |
| Introduced In       | Java 7                                   | Java 5                             |
| Method Signature    | `void close() throws Exception`          | `void close() throws IOException` |
| Use Case            | General-purpose (any resource)           | Mostly for IO classes              |

If you want, I can show how to use it with JDBC, file operations, or even create a custom resource class. Just say the word üòÑ
